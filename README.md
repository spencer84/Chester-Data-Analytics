# Chester-Data-Analytics
Analysis of land data within Chester, England produced using available open source data

I am using this project as a training ground to learn about data science/data engineering through the following exercises:

1.) Combine EPC and HM Land Registry data for a rich, open source datset
2.) Produce a model to estimate house prices (using Land Registry Price Paid data and various types of ML models)
3.) Predict the year of building construction using a KNN model
